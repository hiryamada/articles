# Information sources to help you learn about Azure services

In this article, I will introduce you to a number of information sources that will help you understand Azure services. After reading this article, you'll know where to look for answers when you have questions about Azure services.

This article uses Azure Cosmos DB (Azure's NoSQL database service) as an example. 

**However, you can find similar information sources for all other Azure services.**

## Microsoft Learn

First, you can quickly find materials to help you learn Cosmos DB on **Microsoft Learn**. Go to the page below and search for the keyword `Cosmos DB`.
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/browse/

## Official Product Page

On the **official Azure Cosmos DB product page**, you will find some important features of Cosmos DB, the latest features, typical use cases, customer usage examples, links to YouTube videos and X (Twitter) accounts, FAQs, etc.
https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/cosmos-db

## Documents

For more detailed information, please refer to the official documentation. The **introduction** (home page) of the document explains important features of Cosmos DB.
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/introduction

Particularly useful in the official documentation is a group of pages called **quickstarts**. Here, the first steps to using Cosmos DB are explained in an easy-to-understand manner.
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/nosql/quickstart-dotnet

In addition, there are many pages called **tutorials** in the official documentation. You can learn more how to use it here.
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/nosql/tutorial-dotnet-web-app

You should also read the **FAQ** in the official documentation.
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/faq

## Development Information

If you want to develop an app or system that accesses Cosmos DB to read and write data, use the Azure SDK developed by Microsoft. 
You can obtain information about the SDK for .NET on the following pages. 
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/nosql/sdk-dotnet-v3

There are also SDKs and explanation pages for other languages such as Java and Python.

All SDKs and tools can be accessed from **Azure SDK Download** page.
https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/downloads/

All Azure services are called via REST API. 
You can find all the detailed specifications of the Cosmos DB by reading the **REST API reference**.
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cosmos-db/

## Resource Deployment

You can use ARM Template, Azure Bicep, and Terraform to define and deploy Cosmos DB accounts.
You can find detailed information from the **resource definition reference page**.
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/templates/microsoft.documentdb/databaseaccounts

You can also use Azure portal, Azure CLI or Azure PowerShell to deploy Azure resources.
You can find that information in the **quickstart** pages in official documentation.

## Price and SLA

If you would like to know the detailed SLA of Azure services, the following page may be helpful.
https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/docs/view/Service-Level-Agreements-SLA-for-Online-Services?lang=1

If you want to know about Cosmos DB pricing, check out each product's **pricing** page.
https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/cosmos-db/autoscale-provisioned/

Additionally, the **Pricing Calculator** is useful for estimating how much it will cost to actually use Cosmos DB.

## Blog Articles - preview, generally available, rebranding or updates

Microsoft products may change names from time to time. Azure Cosmos DB was previously known as Azure DocumentDB. Many features of Azure DocumentDB are inherited by Cosmos DB. Therefore, the old blog articles on DocumentDB are also useful to quickly understand the essence of Cosmos DB.
https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/updates/documentdb-customers-welcome-to-azure-cosmos-db/

The following is a blog when Azure DocumentDB was in preview.
https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/updates/preview-documentdb/

Also, below is the blog when Azure DocumentDB became Generally Available. There are also links to more detailed blog articles.
https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/updates/general-availability-azure-documentdb/

## Connection with other services

You might also want to check out some of the connections between Cosmos DB and other Azure products. 

For example, you can use **Azure Data Factory** to copy data from another service to Cosmos DB, or to copy data from Cosmos DB to another service.
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-factory/connector-azure-cosmos-db?tabs=data-factory

You can use **Azure AI Search** to index Cosmos DB data and quickly search data in Cosmos DB from your application.
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/search-howto-index-cosmosdb

**Azure Synapse Link** for Azure Cosmos DB allows you to quickly analyze Cosmos DB data with Azure Synapse Analytics.
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/synapse-link

You can use **Microsoft Defender for Azure Cosmos DB** to protect your Cosmos DB accounts.
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/nosql/defender-for-cosmos-db

You can also use **Azure Functions** and **Azure Logic Apps** for data access and event processing to Cosmos DB.
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-create-cosmos-db-triggered-function

https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/connectors/connectors-create-api-cosmos-db

## Social Networks and Communities

There are so many videos on YouTube where you can quickly learn about Cosmos DB. 
I especially recommend the **Azure Cosmos DB Essential Series**.
